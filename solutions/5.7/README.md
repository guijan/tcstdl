# Exercise 5.7
__[Very Hard] Alter the program from the previous exercise to work safely even
on an implementation that aborts execution on integer overflow. Assume that the
program cannot regain control once overflow controls.__

Solving this exercise is impossible for signed integer types, and trivial for
unsigned integer types, see the explanation in my solution to
[Exercise 5.6](../5.6/README.md).
