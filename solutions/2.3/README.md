# Exercise 2.3
__A name in C begins with a letter. Any number of additional letters, digits,
or underscore characters follow. Write the function
`size_t idlen(const char *s)` that returns the number of characters that
constitute the identifier beginning at `s`. If no identifier begins at `s`,
the function returns zero.__
