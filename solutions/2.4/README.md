# Exercise 2.4
__Write the function `size_t detab(char *dest, const char *src)` that copies
the null-terminated string beginning at `src` to `dest`, with each horizontal
tab replaced by one to four spaces. Assume tab stops every four columns.
A printing character occupies one column. The only other characters that affect
the print position are backspace, carriage return, and newline. Return the
length of the new string at dest.__

See my solution at [detab.c](detab.c).
